title: Rails routing conditions for a DRY routes.rb file
---

h3. Stefan Natchev | 15 April 2013

Rails routing gives you the ability to set any number of "scopes":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing and "constraints":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#request-based-constraints on your routes. These conditions must all match for the route to match. Sometimes, we want to have any one of the conditions to be true in order to match a route.

For example, we want both of these urls to route to the same actions:

* With a path prefix @http://www.example.com/api/register@
* With a subdomain @http://api.example.com/register@

Unfortunately, the following mapping produces a condition on both having the subdomain _and_ path prefix.

{% highlight ruby %}
constraints subdomain: "api" do
  scope "/api" do
    controller :api do
      post :register
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

That route will only match @http://api.example.com/api/register@. Not quite what we are looking for.

h4. First Implementation

Initially, we would have to duplicate all of our endpoints wrapped in a subdomain constraint and a path scope:

{% highlight ruby %}
Rails::Application.routes.draw do

  constraints subdomain: "api" do
    controller :api do
      resources :widget
      post :register
      get :help
    end
  end

  scope "/api" do
    controller :api do
      resources :widget
      post :register
      get :help
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This is not a great solution since any new controller actions would require changes in two places.

h4. A Better Way

A neat trick is to define a method inside the routes block that emits the routes. This can then be wrapped by the scope and constraints conditional.

{% highlight ruby %}
Rails::Application.routes.draw do

  def api_endpoints
    controller :api do
      resources :widget
      post :register
      get :help
    end
  end

  constraints subdomain: "api" do
    api_endpoints
  end

  scope "/api" do
    api_endpoints
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}

This is a great way to group your endpoints into logical chunks that can be reused in different contexts.
